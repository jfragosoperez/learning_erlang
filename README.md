Learning Erlang (functional programming language). Some of the examples, will be practices taken from the samples in the book "Programming Erlang" by Joe Armstrong --> https://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang

Some of the other examples are impl. for exercices we've asked to do as homework in the MIRI Master Course in the FIB University.

Other, have been developed just for fun.

NOTE: probably some of the examples are far from being efficient, I apologize for that, I am not an expert, just a learner.
